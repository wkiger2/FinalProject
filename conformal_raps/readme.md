This is from : https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193 and https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal_classification 
with the dataset here: https://berkeley.box.com/shared/static/pouthcomrvxw9hj64oxhacjvqdw3ihlp.gz

I pulled out the argparse lines in the example.py & was able to replicate the study with the dataset above. 
We should throw our model at this and see how it does for an experiment.  

Dataset path should be inserted like this
    imagenet_val\val\(class_folder_names)\(images)
