This is from : https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193 and https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal_classification 
with the dataset here: https://berkeley.box.com/shared/static/pouthcomrvxw9hj64oxhacjvqdw3ihlp.gz

I pulled out the argparse lines in the example.py & was able to replicate the study with the dataset above. 
We should throw our model at this and see how it does for an experiment.
