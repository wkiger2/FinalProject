This is from : https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193 and https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal_classification 
with the dataset here: https://berkeley.box.com/shared/static/pouthcomrvxw9hj64oxhacjvqdw3ihlp.gz

We did a good amount of work getting this code to work with our dataset.  We made several adaptions to the code including making the number of classes (labels) to be calculated from the dataloader.  We also added the adaptive conformal predicitons in this directory to be used.  
 
<br /> 
The relative paths should look like this when finished: <br /> 
 FinalProject\data\data_train_valid_only\data which contains train and valid directories <br /> 
 FinalProject\data\validation_dataset\val which contains the 10 labeled directories with images <br /> 
 Please ensure your paths look like this before running our programs. <br />
