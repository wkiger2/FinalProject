Overall a great proposal. I would like to clarify a few misunderstandings though.

Ablation: Reducing the number of classes of the data is not an ablation study. 
Ablation study is about the AI system (i.e. model, pipeline, training process etc.). 
A rule of thumb is that it should be able to tell you whether a proposed step (e.g. 
add more layers, use a special activation) is useful or unnecessary. It doesn't 
always mean "removing" literally but sometimes can be *replacing* with some simpler 
components. -0.5 as technically this proposal does not have such discussion. 
For this paper, you can try to implement some of the baselines - those without 
"grouping" is essentially a reduced version of the proposed method. You could also 
try different base neural network - in that case, it is not "removing" a component, 
but replacing it.

There seems to be misunderstanding in how you phrase the main task as well. The paper 
does not try to solve the "lack" of certainty. It tries to provide such 
uncertainty/certainty information. If you must, you could say it tries to solve 
the lack of the "conveyance" of certainty.
