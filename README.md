# CS 598 Deep Learning for Healthcare - Spring Semester 2023
Final Project William Kiger (wkiger2@illinois.edu) and Kristopher Gallagher (kmg8@illinois.edu)

# A Second Look at "Fair Conformal Predictors for Applications in Medical Imaging" 
# From: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04392v3.pdf
Steps to run our programs: 
1) The dataset and model must be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yC46cY7UR49-FMBja1Z_AEohmLnXuEWj?usp=sharing
2) Download the model "resnet_18_derm_model_test_v2.pt" and place it in the directory named "model"
3) Unzip the datasets "validation_dataset" & "data_train_valid_only" and place them in the directory named "data"
    The relative paths should look like this when finished: 
        FinalProject\data\data_train_valid_only\data which contains train and valid directories
        FinalProject\data\validation_dataset\val which contains the 10 labeled directories with images
    Please ensure your paths look like this before running our programs.

4) Create conda environment
